# timetube

**timetube**  is a C# application that was intended to be a clone of TimeSnapper. 

It captures periodic screenshots and usage data (process lists, window positions and icons)

I didn't get very far. You probaby just want to get Timesnapper from https://timesnapper.com/

## Why would anyone want to do that  ?

So that you can blog about it, probably.

## How do I use it

You could download it, compile it, and see what happens, but wouldn't be surprised if it no longer works.  

Or you could go to the timesnapper website and buy a copy of that for $30 and save yourself a world of pain.
